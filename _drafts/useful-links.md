### Practical advice

- [Ten Simple Rules for Creating a Good Data Management Plan](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004525)
  <br />
  Article by William K. Michener published in PLOS Computational Biology
  describing how to write a good data management plan putting the steps into the
  context of the data life cycle. .
- [Ten Simple Rules for Digital Data Storage](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097)
  <br />
  Article by Edmund M. Hart et al. published in PLOS Computational Biology
  giving practical advice on how to store and organise data files.
- [How to share data with a statistician](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing)
  <br />
  Guide by Jeff Leek giving practical advice on how to share data with a
  statistician or data scientist
- [Tidy Data](http://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10)
  <br />
  Article by Hadley Wickham published in the Journal of Statistical Software
  introducing the concept of "tidy data", a specific structure that makes it
  easier to visualise and work with the tabular data. 


### Principles

- [The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](http://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)
  <br />
  Article by Mark D. Wilkinson et al. published in Scientific Data describing
  principles required for machines to be able to discover and consume data.

  <br />
  Blog post by Anita de Waard, Helena Cousijn, and IJsbrand Jan Aalbersberg
  describing an extension of the FAIR principles that is meant to function as a
  roadmap for incremental and continual improvements of data management processes
  and systems.


### Implementations
