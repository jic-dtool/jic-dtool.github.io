  <h3>Vision</h3>

  <p>
  To give researchers confidence that their data is safe and secure, we want to
  make data management a seamless and unobtrusive process that happens
  automatically in the background
  </p>

  <p>
  To empower researchers to make use of the most cost-effective storage and
  computing resources available to them we want to make working with data hosted
  in the cloud as easy as working with data on one's own machine.
  </p>

  <p>
  To enable researchers to analyse their data as quickly as possible we want to
  make data processing in the cloud and on high-performance computing clusters
  as easy as processing data on one's own machine.
  </p>


  <h3>Dtool Solutions</h3>

  <p>
  We provide training, advice and custom solutions for simplifying and
  automating data management and processing.
