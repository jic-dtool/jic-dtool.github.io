## About Us


### Tjelvar Olsson

Tjelvar has a background in scientific software development and research.  He
holds a position as a scientific computing lab manager at the John Innes
Centre, where helps the research groups manage and analyse the data they
produce.

He did his undergraduate and PhD in biochemistry at University College London.
During this time he collected data from the literature and used it to derive
new knowledge about the thermodynamics of protein-ligand interactions.

After finishing his PhD Tjelvar worked at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data
Centre, where he ended up managing the development efforts of their
life-science products.

Tjelvar is interested in how science and technology impact individuals and
society at large. In particular how we can use computers and software to do
better research and make life easier for ourselves.
