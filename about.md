      <h3>Dr Tjelvar Olsson</h3>
      <p>
      Tjelvar has a background in scientific software development and research.  He
      holds a position as a scientific computing lab manager at the John Innes
      Centre, where he works with research groups to help manage and analyse the
      data they produce.
      </p>

      <p>
      He did his undergraduate and PhD in biochemistry at University College London.
      After finishing his PhD Tjelvar worked at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data
      Centre managing their life-science products.
      </p>

      <p>
      Tjelvar is interested in how science and technology impact individuals
      and society. In particular how we can use computers to do better research
      and make life easier for ourselves.

  <h3>Vision</h3>

  <p>
  To give researchers confidence that their data is safe and secure we want to
  make data management a seamless and unobtrusive process that happens
  automatically in the background
  </p>

  <p>
  To empower researchers to make use of the most cost-effective storage
  resources we want to make access to data hosted
  in the cloud as easy as if it was on one's own machine.
  </p>

  <p>
  To enable researchers to analyse their data as quickly as possible we want to
  make data processing in the cloud and on high-performance computing clusters
  as easy as analysing data on one's own machine.
