  <h3>Vision</h3>

  <p>
  We want to make data management a seamless and unobtrusive process that happens
  automatically in the background, giving researchers confidence that their data
  is safe and secure.
  </p>

  <p>
  We want to make it possible to work with data hosted in the cloud as easy as
  working with data on one's own machine, to enable researchers to make use of the
  most cost-effective storage and computing resources available to them.
  </p>

  <p>
  We want to make data processing in the cloud and on high-performance
  computing clusters as easy as processing data on one's own machine, to empower
  researchers to process their data as quickly as possible.
  </p>


  <h3>Dtool Solutions</h3>

  <p>
  We provide training and advice on data management and custom solutions for
  processing data.
