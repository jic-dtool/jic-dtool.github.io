      Managing and processing data is an essential aspect of modern quantitative
      biological research. However, this does not mean that it is easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To meet this challenge we have built up tools and training material to help
      researchers organise and process their data more easily and cost-effectively.

          Our tools provide programatic access to the items in a dataset. This makes it
          easy to fit datasets into processing pipelines.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          We have built processing tools that allow a data centring approach to compute,
          transforming one dataset into another dataset. Taking a data centric approach
          to compute is powerful because it automates many of the overheads associated
          with managing data.
