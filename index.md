Managing and processing data is an essential aspect of modern quantitative
biological research. However, this does not mean that it is easy.

To tackle this we have invested time and effort into building up both tooling
and training material to help researchers organise and process their data more
easily and cost-effectively.

## Package data into a beautiful box

Package data and metadata into a beautiful box.

## Organise your data

Packaging the data and metadata into self contained box makes it easy to move
around and organise.

## Locate your data

The packaged metadata makes it easy to find a box of interest in among lots of
other boxes.

## Verify the integrity of your data

The packaged metadata can be used to verify the integrity of the data items in
the box.

## Process your data

Boxed data fits into processing pipelines. Taking a data centric approach to
compute, going from dataset to dataset, is powerful because it automates many
of the overheads associated with managing data.
