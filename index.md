<p>
Managing and processing data is an essential aspect of modern quantitative
biological research. However, this does not mean that it is easy.
</p>

<p>
To meet this challenge we have built up tools and training material to help
researchers organise and process their data more easily and cost-effectively.

### How does it work?

Our tools allow researchers to package data and metadata into a beautiful box.
We refer to this box as a dataset.

Having the data and metadata packaged as a self contained whole makes it easy
to move around and organise. Furthermore, the tools work with both traditional
file system as well as cloud options such as Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure
giving researchers the ability to chose the storage solution that best suits
their needs.

The packaged metadata can be used to locate a box of interest in among lots of
other boxes.

The packaged metadata can also be used to verify the integrity of the data
items in the box giving researchers peace of mind that the data underpinning
their scientific results are safe and secure.

### Improved Data Processing

Our tools provide programatic access to the items in a dataset. This makes it
easy to fit datasets into processing pipelines.

We have built processing tools that allow a data centring approach to compute,
transforming one dataset into another dataset. Taking a data centric approach
to compute is powerful because it automates many of the overheads associated
with managing data.
